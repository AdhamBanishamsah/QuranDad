# 🔧 Fix App Store Kids Category Rejection

## 🚨 Problem
Apple rejected your app because it's currently set to the "Kids Category" but your Quran app is designed for all ages, not specifically for children under 11.

## ✅ Solution Steps

### 1. Log into App Store Connect
- Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
- Sign in with your Apple Developer account

### 2. Navigate to Your App
- Click on your app: "القرآن بصوت نظام بني شمسة"
- Go to the **"App Information"** tab

### 3. Fix Age Rating Settings
- Scroll down to **"Age Rating"** section
- Click on **"Age Rating"** to edit
- **CRITICAL:** Set **"Made for Kids"** to **NO** ⚠️
- Complete the age rating questionnaire for **4+ (Everyone)**
- Save the changes

### 4. Check App Categories
- In the same "App Information" section
- Make sure:
  - Primary Category: **Education**
  - Secondary Category: **Lifestyle**
  - Do NOT select "Kids" as any category

### 5. Update App Review Information
- Go to **"App Review Information"** section
- Add this note to the reviewer:
  ```
  This is a Quran recitation app designed for all ages (4+), not specifically for children under 12. 
  It's an educational/religious app suitable for families but not exclusively for kids.
  ```

### 6. Resubmit Your App
- Go to **"TestFlight"** or **"App Store"** tab
- Select your latest build (Build #6)
- Click **"Submit for Review"**
- Make sure to mention the age rating fix in the submission notes

## 📝 Key Points to Remember

- **"Made for Kids" = NO** (This is the main fix!)
- **Age Rating = 4+ (Everyone)**
- **Categories = Education + Lifestyle**
- **NOT Kids Category**

## 🎯 Why This Happened

Apple has strict guidelines for apps in the Kids Category. Your Quran app is:
- ✅ Educational and religious content
- ✅ Suitable for all ages
- ❌ NOT specifically designed for children under 12
- ❌ Should NOT be in Kids Category
